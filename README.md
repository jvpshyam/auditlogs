## Disclaimer
Please note that this repository is example code and is not supported by Salesforce.  This code has not been rigorously tested nor performance tested for throughput and scale.

This code is provided as an example only.  The underlying [CometD library](https://cometd.org/) is what provides the meat here, as EMP Connector is a thin wrapper around this library.
